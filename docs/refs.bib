  abstract = {In the tandem groove rolling process, when a certain amount of wear on the work roll exists and the roll speed is not changed, the roll gap, i.e. the section height, should be adjusted to keep a mass balance between stands, i.e. multiply the exit cross-sectional area by the roll speed between stands. To investigate the actual relationship between the amount of wear on the work roll and the subsequent exit cross-sectional area variation, the authors designed wear contours and machined them on the original roll groove, i.e. on the roll groove with no wear. They then performed a pilot hot rolling test using a work roll with a worndown groove and one with a groove with no wear, and measured the exit cross-sectional area of the workpiece while the roll gap changed.},

  abstract = {To investigate a correlation between the amount of wear and roll gap (pass height) adjustment, we performed a single-stand reversible pilot groove rolling test as well as rolling test in an actual rod mill. In case of the pilot rolling test, we designed wear contour (profile) and machined it on the original roll groove (i.e., roll groove with no wear) to make the roll groove worn down. For the actual rod mill test, we developed a measuring device which can detect the actual wear profile.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an approximate model to predict the spread and surface profile of cross sections of material in a Kocks mill that a string of mills driven by three-roll is lined-up in tandem. The spread at the exit of roll gap is expressed as a function of the effective roll diameter, area fraction of the cross section of incoming material intersecting the roll groove shape, and contact length at the interface of the roll and material. The surface profile of a material is assumed to be a second-order polynomial function; additionally, the shape of the function was determined by the shape of the cross section of the incoming material, roll gap geometry, maximum width, and the reduction ratio. We then evaluated the possibility of 3D FE analysis, which is generally used for predicting the surface profile of materials in a three-roll rolling system, being superseded by the model proposed in this study. The generality and robustness of the model proposed in this study was verified by comparing the approximate model-predictions with FE analysis. Difference in terms of the maximum width, B1, was in the range of 0.05{\textasciitilde}0.76 \% and those in terms of the surface profile radius, Rs, ranged from 0.54 to 1.23 \%.},
